# Specification Quality Checklist: Synchronized Multi-Event Metrics Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: Thursday, April 30, 2026
**Feature**: [specs/013-metrics-multi-event-sync/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification clearly defines the behavior for single vs double metrics events.
- The state replacement logic is explicitly captured as a functional requirement.
- Visual filtering (nulls and control flags) is well-defined.
